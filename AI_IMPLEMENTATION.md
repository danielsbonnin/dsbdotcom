# AI Implementation Summary

## Task Information
- **Issue:** #40
- **Title:** [AI-TASK] Test AI Agent Workflow
- **Type:** Development
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Generated:** 2025-05-29T08:40:31.245Z

## Implementation Analysis
This task requires verifying the AI agent workflow.  Since the provided files suggest an existing CI/CD pipeline and AI agent integration, the implementation focuses on creating a simple component to trigger a test event, which will then be handled by the existing workflow.  This avoids modifying the core workflow scripts or introducing complexity.

## Files Modified (2)
- **src\app\test\page.tsx** (create): This page provides a simple UI to trigger the AI agent test. It uses a fetch request to a new API route (`/api/test-ai-agent`) which will handle interaction with the workflow.
- **src\app\api\test-ai-agent\route.ts** (create): This API route is used by the test page to trigger the workflow.  In a production setting, this would use the appropriate methods to interact with your CI/CD system to start the AI workflow run.

## Setup Instructions
1. Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
3. Navigate to `/test` in your browser to see the test page.
4. Replace the placeholder comment in `src/app/api/test-ai-agent/route.ts` with code to interact with your AI workflow trigger.  This might involve calls to the Github API or similar depending on your setup.  Ensure error handling is in place.

## Next Steps
1. Review the generated code for quality and correctness
2. Test the implementation locally
3. Deploy by merging the pull request
