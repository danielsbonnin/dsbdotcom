# AI Implementation Summary

## Task Information
- **Issue:** #47
- **Title:** ðŸŽ¨ Improve color scheme for better accessibility and contrast
- **Type:** Development
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Generated:** 2025-05-29T09:42:09.352Z

## Implementation Analysis
The implementation will involve updating the Tailwind CSS configuration to define a new, accessible color palette.  Then, we'll update the components (Navbar, Footer, and potentially page.tsx) to use the new colors, ensuring WCAG AA contrast compliance.  We'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes for efficient styling and maintainability.

## Files Modified (4)
- **tailwind.config.ts** (modify): This file is modified to include a new color palette that meets accessibility guidelines. The primary color is a more accessible blue, and the accent color is an orange that provides sufficient contrast.
- **src\/components\/Navbar.tsx** (modify): The Navbar component is updated to use the new color palette from tailwind.config.ts.  The background is set to the primary color and text is white for good contrast.
- **src\/components\/Footer.tsx** (modify): The Footer component is updated to use the primary color for background and white for text, maintaining accessibility.
- **src\/app\/layout.tsx** (modify): The layout component now includes the updated Navbar and Footer components.

## Setup Instructions
Run \"npm install" to install necessary packages. Then, run \"npm run dev\" to start the development server. Update any other components using gray text to ensure WCAG AA compliance using the new color palette defined in tailwind.config.ts

## Next Steps
1. Review the generated code for quality and correctness
2. Test the implementation locally
3. Deploy by merging the pull request
