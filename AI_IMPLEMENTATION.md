# AI Implementation Summary

## Task Information
- **Issue:** #27
- **Title:** [AI-TASK] Test AI Agent Fix
- **Type:** Development
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Generated:** 2025-05-29T06:53:06.558Z

## Implementation Analysis
The task requires verifying the AI agent workflow.  Since the provided files suggest an AI agent is used for testing and CI/CD, the implementation will focus on adding a simple test page to confirm its functionality.  This page will display a message indicating success or failure, fetched from a designated endpoint where the AI agent reports its status.  Error handling is included to gracefully manage potential failures.

## Files Modified (2)
- **src/app/ai-agent-status/page.tsx** (create): This page fetches the AI agent status from an API route. It displays a success or failure message based on the response.
- **src/app/api/ai-agent-status/route.ts** (create): This API route simulates fetching the AI agent status. In a real application, this would interact with the actual AI agent to get its status.

## Setup Instructions
1. Run `npm install` to install any necessary dependencies.
2. Start the Next.js development server: `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to `/ai-agent-status` in your browser to view the AI agent status.  Modify `getAiAgentStatus` in `src/app/api/ai-agent-status/route.ts` to integrate with your actual AI Agent.

## Next Steps
1. Review the generated code for quality and correctness
2. Test the implementation locally
3. Deploy by merging the pull request
