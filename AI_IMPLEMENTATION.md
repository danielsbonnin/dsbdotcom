# AI Implementation Summary

## Task Information
- **Issue:** #23
- **Title:** Test AI Agent Workflow - Comprehensive Test
- **Type:** Development
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Generated:** 2025-05-29T05:44:04.382Z

## Implementation Analysis
The implementation creates a new `ContactForm` component in `src/components/ContactForm.tsx`. This component handles form input, validation, and submission.  A new page `src/app/contact/page.tsx` is created to render the component.  Basic validation checks for empty fields and email format are included.  Tailwind CSS is used for styling, aiming for a consistent look with the existing website (though without knowing the existing styles, this is an approximation).  Form submission currently logs the data to the console; a backend integration would need to be added for a production-ready solution.
