# AI Implementation Summary

## Task Information
- **Issue:** #44
- **Title:** [AI-TASK] Please fix the styling
- **Type:** Feature Development
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Generated:** 2025-05-29T08:52:24.158Z

## Implementation Analysis
The task lacks specific styling issues to address.  This solution assumes general improvements to the existing styling are needed, focusing on responsiveness and consistency. It will enhance the \"src/app/layout.tsx\" and \"src/app/page.tsx\" files to incorporate better styling and structure using Tailwind CSS, and add a basic global style for better responsiveness.

## Files Modified (3)
- **src/app/layout.tsx** (modify): Updated layout to include Inter font and basic structure, removing unnecessary divs for better performance and clarity.
- **src/app/page.tsx** (modify): Modified page to use a flexbox layout for better responsiveness. Added simple content for demonstration.
- **src/app/globals.css** (modify): Added basic global styles and responsive font sizes using media queries for better responsiveness.

## Setup Instructions
Run \"npm install\" to install dependencies. Then, run \"npm run dev\" to start the development server.  This will apply the changes and start the Next.js development server. Remember to customize the content and styling to match your portfolio's design.

## Next Steps
1. Review the generated code for quality and correctness
2. Test the implementation locally
3. Deploy by merging the pull request
