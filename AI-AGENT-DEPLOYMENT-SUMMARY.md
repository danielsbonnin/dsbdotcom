## 🔧 Issues Fixed During Testing

### 1. **Issue Parsing Logic** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Task type extraction was failing (extracting "Priority" instead of "Component Development")
- **Solution**: Enhanced regex patterns with fallback logic for multiple markdown formats
- **Result**: Now correctly parses task types from various issue templates

### 2. **Mock GitHub API Functions** ✅ FIXED  
- **Problem**: Mock function calls weren't being tracked (function context issues)
- **Solution**: Refactored to use arrow functions with separate call tracking arrays
- **Result**: All notification tests now pass with proper call verification

### 3. **Test Assertion Logic** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Tests were looking for Jest-style `mock.calls` instead of our custom `calls`
- **Solution**: Updated all test assertions to use the correct property names
- **Result**: End-to-end integration tests now pass
