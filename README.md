This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## ðŸ¤– AI Agent Development System

This repository includes an automated AI agent that can handle development tasks assigned through GitHub Issues. Simply create an issue with the "ðŸ¤– AI Agent Task" template, and an AI agent will automatically implement the requested feature or fix.

**Quick Start with AI Agent:**
1. Go to Issues â†’ New Issue
2. Select "ðŸ¤– AI Agent Task" template  
3. Describe what you want built
4. Watch as the AI agent creates a pull request with the implementation!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
